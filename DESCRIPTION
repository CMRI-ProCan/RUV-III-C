Description: Variations of Remove Unwanted Variation-III (RUV-III) known as RUV-III-C (RUV-III Complete). RUV-III performs normalisation using negative control variables and replication. RUV-III-C extends this method to cases where the data contains missing values, by applying RUV-III to complete subsets of the data. Originally designed for SWATH-MS proteomics datasets.
