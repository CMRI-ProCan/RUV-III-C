#' Peptide data from the cross-lab study of Collins et al (2017)
#'
#' A dataset containing the peptide-level data from the cross-lab study of Collins et al (2017), originally published in Nature Communications. The data consists of a data.frame named \code{peptideData}, and a character vector sisPeptides, listing the peptides that should be analysed. 
#' @format A data.frame containing peptide-level data, with peptides that were not detected coded as NA. All columns are peptides, except for \code{filename}, \code{site}, \code{mixture}, \code{grouping} and \code{Date}.
